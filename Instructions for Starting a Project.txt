Instructions for Starting a Project

What does the thing that you want to create do?
    I want to create a calculator that prompts user and allows for basic calculations
How do things interact/Create a psuedo code?
    While not exit do

    end
How many and what modules will there be?
    input
    do_operation
    output
What is the Architecture?

    ~General Rules~
    H = History of last 10 calculations? Would require writing something to keep ahold of the history.

    ~Executory functions~ These functions will cause the application to end in a way that will restart or end the progress.
        C = clear input, needs to be available on every prompt - "Main Menu"
            Needs to set operation variable to nil upon execution of clear
        Q = Exit, needs to be available on every prompt

        ~Workflow:~
        Prompt User for a number
        Give user options between "0-X" - "The Main Menu"
        Once an option is selected perform option's action
            I.E(of calculator) 0 for addition, 1 for subtraction and PEMDAS order on.
                Each operation will have its own function.
        Upon selecting option, action will prompt user to input a number or go back to "Main Menu" (positive or negative)
        Upon receiving the number ask for another action ("main Menu") or clear input
        And so on until user hits a "executory function"
